# First Hand Pebble Watchface

Ever wanted to rock a little support for First Hand on your Pebble watch?

...

Well for those of you who still have one, now you can!

To test, I would recommend putting this code in a Github repo and then opening it in [cloudpebble](https://cloudpebble.net/)

Also, be sure to take the .txt extension off of the wscript file. I only put it there to make sure that Python didn't show up as a language until I made an actual Python contribution.
