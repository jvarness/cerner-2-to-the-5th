# Github Followers Elm SPA

Wanna check to see if you have 32 followers on Github? Wanna check to see if someone else does? Look no further!

To test, first install [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html), then on the command line:

```
elm reactor
``` 

Once the server starts up, just open `localhost:8000` on your browser, and you will have yourself a neat little Elm SPA!
