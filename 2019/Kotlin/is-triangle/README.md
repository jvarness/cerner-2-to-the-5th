# is-triangle

There's a theory in trig that for 3 given numbers, for each combination of sides a, b, and c you could make, if the addition of two of the sides is greater than the third, you can make a triangle. However, if the sum of the two sides is less than or equal to the third, then there is no way the 3 numbers could comprise a triangle.

## How to run

I got bored using the command line, so I wrote the code using the [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/).
