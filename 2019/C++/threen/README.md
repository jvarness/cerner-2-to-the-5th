# threen

I downloaded a bunch of homework assignments from my C++ class back in high school, and one of them was the 3N + 1 problem.

Googling revealed to me that this is also referred to as the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

So I made a C++ solution.

## How to run

I'm using g++ for this, so compile the program and run it like this:

```
g++ threen.cpp -o threen.out
./threen.out
```
