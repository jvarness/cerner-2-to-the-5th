# next-demo

This submission shows you how to make a PWA using [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/).

## How to run

You need to get [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) (get the 10.X version), and after that, you have to run:

```
npm i
npm i -g now
```

Then, you can either run it locally:

```
next
```

Or deploy the project to [Zeit](https://zeit.co):

```
now
```
