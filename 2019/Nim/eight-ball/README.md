# eight-ball

[Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) is a unique programming language that I wanted to try for some time.

This is a very small Nim program that acts as a magic eight ball.

## How to run

Install Nim, and then run:

```
nim c -r eightball.nim
```

Make sure you install the latest version of Nim. I would suggest using [choosenim](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim#choosenim).
