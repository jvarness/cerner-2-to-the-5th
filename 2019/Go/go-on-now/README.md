# go-on-now

Ever use [Go](https://golang.org/)? Ever use it to make microservices? Ever use [Zeit](https://zeit.co)? Ever wish you could deploy your Go microservices on Zeit? Well [`now`](https://zeit.co/docs) you can!

## How to run

Install the latest LTS of [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) (you need at least 10 in order for `now` to work correctly), and then you can either run the project locally:

```
now dev
```

Or, if you have a Zeit account, deploy it using:

```
now
```
