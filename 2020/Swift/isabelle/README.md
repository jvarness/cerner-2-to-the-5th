# isabelle

Have you spent your whole summer playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons? I sure have! I really like all the villagers, and that's why I'm using Swift's native HTTP libraries to have this file go fetch a random one from [ACNH API](http://acnhapi.com/) and print out information about them!

## How to run

Go make sure you have XCode installed on your Mac, and then run:

`swift isabelle.swift`
