# blathers-v2

I created a Ruby example of how to call the [ACNH API](http://acnhapi.com/) to get a random bug. Now 
I'm back to get a random sea creature 😁

## How to run

Ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, ensure that `blathers` has run permissions on your 
file system (has to be `chmod`'d to be executable), then you can simply run:

`./blathers`
