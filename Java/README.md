# Stack Overflow

No, not the website you copy into your team's prod environment, I'm talking about when you're writing some Java code that's recursive and 
you overflow the stack.

Now you'll be able to see how many stack frames your Java Runtime can handle!

To test, have the Java JDK installed and on your path, then run the following commands:

```
javac Impact.java
java Impact
```
