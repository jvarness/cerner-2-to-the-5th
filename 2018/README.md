# 2018 submissions

The year of the web! Many of the submissions here either create a web application or run a web server, spanning multiple languages and technologies. Some of my favorite submissions are:

- A small Vue TODO app contained in a single HTML file
- A microservice that uses micro
- A web service written in Swift using Vapor that calculates the Nth fibonacci number
- A service written in Crystal that will talk back to you using web sockets

Can't wait for 2019!
