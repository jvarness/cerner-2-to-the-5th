# bob

From [exercism](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/blob/master/exercises/bob/description.md):

>Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
>
>Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
>
>He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.
>
>He answers 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.
>
>He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.
>
>He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
>
>Bob's conversational partner is a purist when it comes to written communication and always follows normal rules regarding sentence punctuation in English.

So basically Bob is a poor man's version of alexa with way less features.
