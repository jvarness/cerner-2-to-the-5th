# futures

A small [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) program that demonstrates Dart's `async` capabilities using [`Stream`s](https://www.dartlang.org/tutorials/language/streams).

# How to run

To get started, install the [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/get-started), add the Dart executables to your path, then execute:

```
dart futures.dart
```

And be amazed at the asynchronous processing that occurs in Dart!!
